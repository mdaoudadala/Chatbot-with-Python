# Creating a Chatbot using Python

### What is a Chatbot?

A Chatbot is an AI application designed to simulate human conversations. It is commonly utilized by companies to address routine inquiries and issues from customers. For instance, if you need to retrieve your bank account's CRN (Customer Reference Number), a chatbot can guide you through the process by requesting your bank details and providing the CRN.
